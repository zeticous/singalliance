The global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) is computed in closed form. The efficient frontier is then computed using the 
two-fund theorem, where a linear combination of the GMVP and the maximum return asset can be used to form the frontier.

The minimum variance portfolio is found in `gmvp.txt` and the efficient frontier is found in `frontier.png`.
